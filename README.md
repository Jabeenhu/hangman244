# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The user will need to input single letter guesses. If the guesses are correct the letter location in the word will be revealed. If the guess is wrong, one life will be taken. The user has 5 lifes before the game is over.
